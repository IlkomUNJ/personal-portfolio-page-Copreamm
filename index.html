          In this competition, I designed a logo for an Islamic festival. I was
          responsible for the entire process, starting from brainstorming
          concepts, creating the final logo, and implementing it into real use
          cases. Additionally, I developed a brand guideline to ensure
          consistent usage of the logo across different media.
