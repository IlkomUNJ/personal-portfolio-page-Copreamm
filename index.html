            In this competition, I designed a logo for an Islamic festival. I was
            responsible for the entire process, starting from brainstorming
            concepts, creating the final logo, and implementing it into real use
            cases. Additionally, I developed a brand guideline to ensure
            consistent usage of the logo across different media.

          During my studies at Universitas Negeri Jakarta, I have explored several programming 
          languages. In my first semester, I learned Python, which is very popular today, as 
          well as DLang to practice the basics of programming logic. In the second semester, 
          I continued to deepen my understanding of data structures and algorithms using 
          Python. Currently, in my third semester, I am studying object-oriented programming 
          with C++ and web programming using HTML and CSS. Through HTML and CSS, I have 
          learned many important skills that will be valuable for developing my future 
          portfolio.
